# Travel Planner - Senior Project
https://publicplanner.hannahripley.com

I made this travel planner as my senior project for my Web Development degree. It is built entirely in ReactJS, using quite a lot of components and JSX. It also uses Redux for state management and a couple libraries such as MomentJS and ChartJS for making things work a little easier.

This travel planner has two main features - the itinerary and the budgeter. The itinerary is organized by 'event' instead of by day. An event is either a city or a transit. A city, for example could be 'Paris' and would also include information such as date of arrival, how many days, and cost per day. A transit could be a 'Flight' and includes the starting point, destination, date, time, and price.

The budgeter takes all the cost information from the itinerary and builds a budget. You can then put in money actually spent and see in what areas you are above or below budget. There is also a chart that will give you a breakdown of where money is spent. 

The other features are tickets, to-do list, packing list, and the homepage, which has a quick glance of other features.

# REACT INFORMATION
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
